## 💭 Abstract
This project develops a user-friendly dashboard for travelers to log in and view their trip history. Travelers can use a dropdown bar to view their expenses on trips within a selected year, factoring in a 10% travel agent's fee. 

Additionally, they have the option to add new trips by providing details such as start date, end date, number of travelers, and destination. Clicking the 'Add Trip' button reveals the estimated cost for the new trip, including the 10% travel agent fee. Furthermore, clicking that button updates the upcoming and pending trips for the traveler. Travelers can add more trips to view the estimated cost for each.

This platform ensures accessibility for travelers, allowing them to navigate through the application using tabs. Additionally, the platform is screen reader-friendly, ensuring that users with visual impairments can effectively engage with the content and functionality of the application.
